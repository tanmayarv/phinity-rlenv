Specification to RTL Task:

Implement a complete asynchronous FIFO module based on the specification in /workdir/docs/Specification.md. The RTL code must be fully synthesizable and optimized for safe Clock Domain Crossing (CDC).

Your implementation must include:

1. **Dual-port memory array** for FIFO storage
2. **Binary and Gray code pointers** for both read and write domains
3. **Binary-to-Gray conversion logic** for pointer synchronization
4. **Two-stage synchronizers** to safely cross Gray pointers between clock domains
5. **Full and empty detection logic** based on Gray pointer comparison
6. **Proper reset handling** for both clock domains (asynchronous, active-low)

Key Requirements:

- Module name must be: `async_fifo`
- Parameters: `DATA_WIDTH` (default 8) and `DEPTH` (default 16, must be power of 2)
- Pointer width: `$clog2(DEPTH) + 1` bits (extra bit for wraparound detection)
- Gray code encoding is REQUIRED for all pointer synchronization
- Write operations occur on `posedge wclk` when `wen && !wfull`
- Read pointer updates on `posedge rclk` when `ren && !rempty`
- **Read data output must be combinational** (use `assign rdata = mem[...]`) for zero-cycle latency
- Memory addressing uses binary pointers; synchronization uses Gray pointers
- Full/empty flags must be accurate even during simultaneous read/write operations

Interface:
```systemverilog
module async_fifo #(
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8,
    parameter DEPTH = 16
)(
    input  wire                  wclk,
    input  wire                  wrst_n,
    input  wire                  wen,
    input  wire [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] wdata,
    output wire                  wfull,
    
    input  wire                  rclk,
    input  wire                  rrst_n,
    input  wire                  ren,
    output wire [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] rdata,
    output wire                  rempty
);
```

Critical Design Considerations:

1. **Metastability**: Gray code changes only 1 bit per increment, preventing multi-bit glitches during CDC
2. **Synchronizers**: Use exactly 2 flip-flop stages to cross clock domains (standard MTBF reduction)
3. **Full detection**: Check MSB and second-MSB differences in Gray pointers (wraparound logic)
4. **Empty detection**: Direct Gray pointer comparison in read domain
5. **Corner cases**: Handle simultaneous read/write, back-to-back operations, and independent resets

Your implementation should create the file: `/workdir/sources/async_fifo.sv`

The specification document provides detailed explanations of Gray code conversion, synchronizer implementation, and full/empty logic. Read it carefully before implementing.

**Important**: This environment uses Icarus Verilog for testing. Avoid using SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) property/sequence syntax if adding assertions. Use standard SystemVerilog constructs compatible with synthesis tools.
