1. Gray Code Conversion: Remember that binary-to-gray conversion is: gray = binary ^ (binary >> 1)

2. Pointer Width: For DEPTH=16, you need 5-bit pointers (4 bits for addressing + 1 extra bit for full/empty detection)

3. Full Detection: FIFO is full when write pointer MSB differs from read pointer MSB, second MSB differs, but remaining bits match in Gray code

4. Empty Detection: FIFO is empty when read Gray pointer exactly equals the synchronized write Gray pointer

5. Synchronizers: Use a 2-stage synchronizer (two sequential flip-flops) to safely cross clock domains

6. Read Output: Use combinational (assign) read, not registered - this is industry standard for zero-cycle latency
